# Login Checklist (Task 5)

## UI & Accessibility
- Labels match fields; placeholders are meaningful; tab order is logical.
- Password is masked; pressing **Enter** submits the form.
- Login button enabled/disabled according to rules; focus returns to the first invalid field.

## Validation
- Empty fields -> clear required messages.
- Trimming: leading/trailing spaces removed; all-whitespace input is rejected.
- Length limits: too short/too long username/password -> proper errors.
- Invalid credentials -> single safe error message (no user enumeration).

## Behavior
- After an error, correcting values and resubmitting leads to successful login.
- After **Logout**, using browser **Back** does not restore authenticated session.
- Rate-limiting/lockouts (if exist) behave predictably; if not present, no UI freeze.

## Security sanity
- Password never appears in URL or console logs.
- No HTML/script injection in fields or error messages.
